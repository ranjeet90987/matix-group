						<h4 class="wow fadeInUp">Ensuring a healthy and safe workplace</h4>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">We prioritise top-rated occupational safety through a robust management system, including Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA) and mitigation procedures and a safety work permit system. We have safety committees at both plant and central levels to oversee implementation, undertake regular EHS discussions, and strategise initiatives. We conduct regular safety training for our employees, and we commemorate National Safety Week to reinforce our commitment to safety ethics and behaviour.</p>

						<p class="wow fadeInUp">We have prepared detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) to effectively manage waste and prevent unforeseen events. All our plant operations have received recognition from TUV-Rheinland for meeting compliance with the international standard of Occupational Health and Safety (ISO 45001:2018) requirements. We have also invested in safer technologies at operations, including dedicated hot and cold flares to prevent the escape of NG and Ammonia and gas detectors to monitor leakages of obnoxious gasses. Our online QR-based reporting system for ‘Near-Miss’ and ‘Unsafe condition/unsafe act’ along with an award scheme helps incentivise reporting, spread awareness, and take swift investigations and corrective measures. Additionally, emergency handling procedures and regular mock drills ensure better site preparedness. We further maintain a 24x7 onsite Occupational Health Centre having qualified doctors, nurses, and pharmacists along with an ambulance for patient transfers. </p>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">We maintain comprehensive health records for each employee. Our initiatives include annual health checkups, a Mediclaim policy that covers employees and their families, First-Aid training, awareness programmes related to communicable diseases, hygiene camps, and leadership connections that foster a socially and professionally satisfying work culture, among others.</p>

						<h4 class="wow fadeInUp">Diversity and inclusion</h4>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">We place a strong emphasis on diversity, not solely in terms of numbers, but also in harnessing a diverse pool of talent to fortify our organisation’s resilience. Our representation of women in the total workforce has gradually increased and remains stable. As a result, we’ve been able to bring women into key support functions. We are currently in the process of designing frameworks for skill development programmes tailored for women employees, fostering their career growth. Furthermore, we are actively exploring opportunities to integrate women employees into our recruitment process for fresh talent.</p>

						<h4 class="wow fadeInUp">Rewards and recognition</h4>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">We are dedicated to cultivating a culture of meritocracy, empowerment, and encouragement to foster high performance and excellence across our diverse global workforce. Our performance appraisal process follows a meticulously structured approach, designed to acknowledge and reward employee performance through a transparent evaluation methodology. This process initiates with employees setting their goals at the start of the year, aligning these objectives with the evolving needs of our business. A roadmap is meticulously crafted, complete with timelines, to guide them toward goal attainment. At the end of each year, a comprehensive performance review is conducted to evaluate and assess employee performance.</p>

						<h4 class="wow fadeInUp">Long Service Award</h4>
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">We deeply appreciate the service of our employees who have contributed ten years of their careers to our organisation. In recognition of this remarkable tenure, we express our gratitude by presenting a appreciation certificate along with a reward on Matix Day. This gesture not only serves to acknowledge their long-standing association but also strengthens the bond between our employees and the employer.</p>
