							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">World Soil Day (WSD) is observed annually on the 5<sup>th</sup> of December across the world. WSD was initiated with the objective of highlighting and promoting the importance of maintaining soil health by educating farmers and the public about sustainable practices.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">At Matix, we support this movement to protect and enhance soil resources. Towards this, we conducted workshops to educate farmers about practices that enhance soil health, including crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage. These workshops emphasised the significance of healthy soil in crop production, food security, and environmental conservation. We encouraged soil testing and collected samples as well as provided guidance to farmers on balanced fertiliser application to ensure nutrient adequacy while preventing soil degradation.</p>

							<h3 class="inner-bluehead wow fadeInUp" data-wow-ffset="200">Strengthening relations with the farming community</h3>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">We serve the farming community by fostering healthy relationships through engagement at events and village-level outreach programmes. These help us to get a better understanding of their challenges and their thought process through multiple planned as well as walkabout meetings.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Collaborating closely with dealers/retailers, especially those affiliated with Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samriddhi Kendra (PMKSK), we have linked farmers with PMKSK centres with the active participation of our area and territory managers (AMs/TMs).</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">These engagements effectively addressed farmers’ concerns along with showcasing our products and services, helping build trust and loyalty and demonstrating our commitment to their success. We focussed on understanding and addressing their fieldrelated problems (current crops, cropping patterns, pests, diseases, soil health) through tailored solutions, including advisory on optimally using our agri inputs and connecting them to farm services. Farmers are now educated on balanced crop nutrition, disease and pest prevention and beneficial government schemes. They are also introduced to Matix Soil Testing Services for optimising crop yields and balanced fertilisers use.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Additionally, we created brand awareness by showcasing our product quality and efficacy through demonstrations and testimonials from progressive farmers. To enhance the impact of engagements, various promotional materials were displayed including activity and product banners, actual product samples and informative posters. We also distributed informational pamphlets, brochures and branded materials (caps, pens, calendars, keyrings etc.).</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">The Government of India introduced the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Kendra (PMKSK) programme, aiming to convert retail fertiliser shops into PMKSK, a one-stop shop for the farmers' fertilisers, seeds and farm equipment needs.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Matix enthusiastically supported this initiative and proudly facilitated the opening of 1,453 PMKSK centres. Our centres at Jharkhand and Nalanda were notably among the few inaugurated by the honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the initial phase and upon surpassing the milestone of 1 lakh PMKSKs.</p>

Conducted across villages, PMKSK centres, mandis, and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), it engages diverse participants including agriculture experts (KVK scientists/subject matter specialists), managers, retailers, dealers and farmers.</p>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200"> Through these sessions, the team gathered insights on the farmers' field-related problems and accordingly provided relevant solutions.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">We conducted multiple dealer and retailer meets during the year to engage with these valuable networks, communicate essential information, and accomplish the set objectives. These events showcased various visual displays that enhanced the overall experience and communication of key messages such as product banners, informational posters and point-of-display items. To foster brand recall and appreciation, we distributed mementoes, Company-branded t-shirts and gifts.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">In addition to these meets, our Managing Director interacted with many dealers across West Bengal, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh.</p>

								<li class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Direct engagement of senior executives and state representatives with the dealers and retailers, helped gain insights into market conditions, competition, farmer challenges and other productrelated discussions; their feedback was also taken for targeted improvement measures</li>

							<h3 class="inner-bluehead wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Catalysing agricultural transformation with crop demonstration</h3>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Our crop demonstration initiative aims to bridge the gap between traditional and modern farming techniques, focussed on boosting crop yields and showcasing the benefits of specific products and agronomy practices. It also helps highlight improved crop yields and physical characteristics, leading to substantial monetary gains and improved quality of life within farming communities.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">The effort includes selecting a demo field and inviting farmers for product briefing, its application and stagewise description. They are encouraged to visit this field later to witness the remarkable difference in yield, physical appearance, and superior quality of harvests, which can enable access to premium markets and higher prices for produce. The programme thus empowers farmers to embrace modern agricultural practices, enhance income and secure the future of agriculture.</p> 
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-offset="200">Local dealers are a crucial component, ensuring ready product availability to interested farmers and facilitating easy adoption. They also serve as a bridge between farmers and agricultural experts, providing essential guidance and support.</p>
