						<h5 class="wow zoomIn">Dear Stakeholders,</h5>
						<h5 class="chairmanp wow fadeInUp">In the past year, the Indian economy displayed resilience and thrived despite global challenges. Robust domestic consumption, healthy growth across all sectors, and the government’s emphasis on self reliance and manufacturing improved the country’s global standing. As a key component of the economy and a priority for food security, the agriculture sector continued its steady growth. The ongoing government support to enhance farm productivity and farmer income remained a boon for the sector, despite the challenges of erratic and late rainfalls and high commodity prices.</h5>
						
						<h4 class="wow zoomIn">Delivering well-rounded performance</h4>
						<p class="wow zoomIn">Amidst this backdrop, Matix delivered a healthy performance, demonstrating the strength of our business model and commitment to farmers' welfare.  </p>
						<p class="wow zoomIn">We broadened our product portfolio and expanded our reach across nine Indian states in the east, northeast and northern regions. The distribution network was made stronger with the addition of 468 dealers and 42,722 retailers during the year, bringing our total to 1,021 dealers and 51,157 retailers as on March 31, 2023. Our plant, built on world-class technology, operated with remarkable efficiency and effectiveness, thanks to the dedication of our skilled team, ensuring sustained above-capacity utilisation.</p>
						<p class="wow zoomIn">We closed FY 2022-23 with production and successful multimodal despatch of 1.05 million MT of urea across our target markets. Revenues reached &#8377; 57,942.34 million with an EBITDA of &#8377; 12,744.84 million, driven by our efficient operations. We expect further margin improvement through ongoing operational stabilisation and efficiency enhancements.</p>
						<div class="chairman-content">
							<img src="svg/chairman-comma-nw.svg" class="wow zoomIn">
							<h3 class="wow zoomIn">We have already initiated the import of DAP and NPK during the year and last-mile delivery is being ensured through our extensive distribution infrastructure. The farming community shall soon benefit from these nutrients.</h3>
							<h4 class="wow zoomIn">Evolving into a total solution provider</h4>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">While urea remains our core business, we understand the indispensable role of non-urea fertilisers, recognising the diverse nutrient needs of different soil types. This significance is evident in the fact that nearly 43% of all fertilisers consumed in India are non-urea based. However, their combined production stands at 13 MTPA against a demand of 25 MTPA, leaving a supply gap of 12 MTPA. </p>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">To bridge this gap and help farmers enhance soil health and yield, we have introduced essential crop nutrients under the Dr. Fasal brand. We have already initiated the import of DAP, NPK and MOP during the year and last mile delivery is being ensured through our extensive distribution infrastructure. The farming community shall soon benefit from these nutrients.</p>
							
							<img src="svg/chairman-comma-nw.svg" class="wow zoomIn">
							<h3 class="wow zoomIn">Matix now holds a unique reputation of serving two vital staple crop-producing regions: east India for rice and north India for wheat, both crucial in the nation’s pursuit of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliance) and food security.</h3>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">Further, insightful feedback from farmers and our team has highlighted a noticeable supply gap in crop protection products. This is crucial considering the high instances of unseasonal rain and crop infestations which impact yields and farmer incomes. In response, we made strategic entry into the agrochemicals space in 2022-23, offering top-quality crop protection products. Concurrently, we are actively promoting Matix Soil Testing Services to support and guide farmers in their soil practices towards a bumper crop. </p>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">With these efforts, we are now amongst the few companies offering full-service solutions to farmers, encompassing crop nutrition, crop protection, and soil testing studies – all seamlessly unified under the umbrella of Matix.</p>

							<h4 class="wow zoomIn">Extending our reach</h4>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">This year, we successfully started serving the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, renowned as top wheat producers in India. Matix now holds a unique reputation of serving two vital staple crop-producing regions: east India for rice and north India for wheat, both crucial in the nation’s pursuit of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliance) and food security. </p>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">Matix is aptly positioned to fulfil the farmer needs in eastern and northeastern parts where we maintain a substantial presence, commanding ~20% market share. We have also set up the distribution infrastructure and supplied products in Tripura, marking our presence in the ninth Indian state.</p>
							<h4 class="wow zoomIn">Positioned to deliver long-term value</h4>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">Matix has grown and evolved substantially in the last year and a half. We are pleased to have built an organisation that has a distinctive competitive edge with an extensive and full-suite portfolio, an ever growing distribution network and an experienced team. Our strategically located plant enables us to achieve national reach with optimised cost, facilitated by seamless connectivity through rail and road.</p>

							<p class="wow zoomIn">Our commitment to sustainability is at the core of our operations. Equipped with proprietary technologies, our plant is designed to consume less energy and water and effectively manage waste. In FY 2022-23, our energy consumption stood at a low of 5.14 Gcal/MT, and we are confident of further improving. Additionally, we maintain a greenbelt covering one-third of our plant area, housing nearly 75,000 plantations.  </p>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">Inspired by our achievements, we are resolute in aiming higher and dedicated to the prosperity of our farmers. Plans are underway to expand capacity and enhance the portfolio of non-urea fertilisers and agrochemicals.</p>
							<p class="wow zoomIn">The future is exciting and the opportunities ahead are abundant. We sincerely seek the continued support and collaboration of all our stakeholders as we navigate this promising journey ahead. </p>
